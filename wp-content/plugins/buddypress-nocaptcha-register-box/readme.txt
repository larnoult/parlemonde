Super-lightweight plugin adds Google's No Captcha reCAPTCHA box to your BuddyPress registration form.

Tough on bots, Easy on humans!

== Description ==

This plugin obviously requires BuddyPress before it will do anything.

You also need to enter your API keys from Google in the settings page. You can choose light or dark theme and add basic CSS styling to the box.

It should help keep your community free from spambots and also hopefully not be too much of a inconvenience for your sites genuine users.

You can set a dark or light theme. The type of captcha can be set to image or audio and there are over 30 languages available for the NoCaptcha box. Or, set it to auto, based on the users browser language.

(Plugin code based on Buddypress ReCaptacha by Hardeep Asrani, modified for latest reCaptcha API.)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure reCAPTCHA settings from Settings > BuddyPress Captcha menu.
