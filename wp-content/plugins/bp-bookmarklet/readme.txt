Let the members of your BuddyPress powered community add a Bookmarklet to their browser to share interesting web pages

== Description ==

Members will find their bookmarklet within a sub menu of their profile's Account Settings if the BuddyPress Settings component is active, else a new profile navigation will be created by the plugin. From this settings page, members can drag the bookmarklet within their browser's bookmarks bar.

Then sharing any internet pages in their activity stream or in a specific group's activity stream can be achieved simply by clicking on this bookmarklet!

A popup window will help them set their preferences about the activity to publish.
