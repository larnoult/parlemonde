Do not add your own translations to this directory. They will be lost during plugin
updates. The only .mo files that should be loaded from here are pre-made translations
that come with the plugin.

Store your translations at:
wp-content/languages/plugins/widget-importer-exporter-$locale.mo
(e.g. widget-importer-exporter-en_US.mo) to keep them safe from loss during updates.

Please feel free to contribute your translation to this project with these instructions:
