New User Approve allows a site administrator to approve a user before they
are able to login to the site.

== Description ==

On a normal WordPress site, once a new user registers, the user is created in the database. Then an email is sent to the new user with their login credentials. Very simple. As it should be.

The New User Approve plugin modifies the registration process. When a user registers for the site, the user gets created and then an email gets sent to the administrators of the site. An administrator then is expected to either approve or deny the registration request. An email is then sent to the user indicating whether they were approved or denied. If the user has been approved, the email will include the login credentials. Until a user is approved, the user will not be able to login to the site.

Only approved users will be allowed to login to site. Users waiting for approval as well as denied users will not be able to login to site.

A user's status can be updated even after the initial approval/denial.

Each user that exists before New User Approve has been activated will be treated as an approved user.

Default WordPress registration process:

1. User registers.
2. User is shown message to check email.
3. Login credentials are sent to new user in an email.
4. User logs in to site using login credentials.
5. Admin is notified of new user sign up via email.

WordPress registration process with New User Approve plugin activated:

1. User registers for access to site.
2. User is shown message to wait for approval.
3. Admin is notified of new user sign up via email.
4. Admin goes to wp-admin to approve or deny new user.
5. Email is sent to user. If approved, email will include login credentials.
6. User logs in to site using login credentials.

**Customize**

New User Approve allows for customizations by using custom actions and filters. You can find out more about these by browsing the source code.

A commercial plugin that adds a config panel for customization is also available at [https://newuserapprove.com/products/options-addon/](https://newuserapprove.com/products/options-addon/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload new-user-approve to the wp-content/plugins directory or download from the WordPress backend (Plugins -> Add New -> search for 'new user approve')
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. No configuration necessary.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why am I not getting the emails when a new user registers? =

The New User Approve plugin uses the functions provided by WordPress to send email. Make sure your host is setup correctly to send email if this happens.

= How do I customize the email address and/or name when sending notifications to users? =

This is not a function of the plugin but of WordPress. WordPress provides the *wp_mail_from* and *wp_mail_from_name* filters to allow you to customize this. There are also a number of plugins that provide a setting to change this to your liking.

* [wp mail from](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-mailfrom/)
* [Mail From](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mail-from/)

= What happens to the user's status after the plugin is deactivated? =

If you deactivate the plugin, their status doesn't matter. The status that the plugin uses is only used by the plugin. All users will be allowed to login as long as they have their username and passwords.

= Are there any known issues with the New User Approve plugin? =

We are aware of a few issues with multisite
1. The status filters on users.php do not work correctly
2. The bubble that shows next to the users link to show the number of pending users does not show

== Screenshots ==

1. The backend to manage approving and denying users. This is an alternative to approving users.
2. Integration with WordPress Users admin page.
3. Filter users by status.
4. Approve or deny users using the bulk edit feature in WordPress.
5. Custom messages on the login screen.
