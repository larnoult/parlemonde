Network content syndication made easy! Automatically share content by multiposting between multisite blogs.

== Description ==

= Network Content Syndication Made Easy! =

Single source content on a Wordpress multisite network is now as easy as pie! Syndicate posts to other blogs in the network, update posts between blogs, sync posts, share content templates, etc. Broadcasted posts can be linked to their parents, which updates child posts when the parent post is updated. This includes all data: title, slug, content, custom fields, attachments, etc.

Broadcast, formerly ThreeWP Broadcast, is great for:

* Chain stores
* Franchises
* News sites
* Schools
* Anything else with distributed content!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need support! =

Broadcast is supported in the forum. For users of the add-on packs, support is available via e-mail.

= Debug dumps =

A debug dump is the long text that is displayed when broadcasting a post with debug mode on. This dump can then be read to see what Broadcast is or isn't doing.

To switch on debug mode, <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/doc/debug-mode/">see the admin settings</a>. If your site is live it would be wise to input your IP in the associated textarea, so that only you see the debug dump.

= Blacklist, whitelisting, force broadcast =

Broadcasting to specific blogs, hiding blogs and forcing blogs can be acheived with the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/user-blog-settings/">User & Blog Settings add-on</a>.

= Bulk broadcast existing pages =

To broadcast many posts at once, see the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/send-to-many/">Send To Many</a> add-on.

= Galleries and attachments =

How broadcast handles attachments:

1. Attachments directly attached are stored.
1. Attachments found in [gallery] shortcodes are stored.
1. On the child blog, the existing attachments to the post, if any, are automatically deleted to keep attachments clean. This behavior can be configured using custom code or add-ons: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/duplicate-attachments/">Duplicate Attachments</a>, <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/update-attachments/">Update Attachments</a>.
1. The stored attachments are copied.
1. The thumbnail ID is replaced.
1. The image URLs in the post content are replaced.
1. The image IDs in [gallery] shortcodes are replaced.

Do you have a lot of attachments that you don't want duplicated to hundreds of child blogs, in order to save space? You'll have to find a way to refer to the images statically instead of using their media IDs. The reason for this is that when Wordpress is referred to an attachment, it can only read the media IDs from the current blog. It cannot switch blogs in order to load the image.

= Hide broadcast from the users =

The broadcast meta box, menu and columns in the post view can be hidden from users / roles / blogs using the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/user-blog-settings/">User & Blog Settings add-on</a>.

= Incompatible plugins =

Below is a list of plugins that just will not work properly with Broadcast and / or its addons:

* <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/intuitive-custom-post-order/">Intuitive Custom Post Order</a> - Prevents broadcasting due to switch_to_blog() mismatch.
* Post Type Switcher - Turns post types into attachments and vice versa.
* Taxonomy Terms Order - prevents terms from being seen.
* <a href="http://intellywp.com/tracking-code-manager/">Tracking Code Manager</a> - prevents User & Blog Settings from working by inserting data into the _POST variable during a normal page GET. Very non-standard behavior.

= Orphans? =

If you have already created posts on other blogs that are supposed to be children of a specific post, you can use the "find unlinked" bulk action to find and link them.

If the existing posts are not linked, broadcasting a post can result in duplicates.

To be considered an orphan the orphaned posts must have the exact same title (name) as the soon-to-be parent and be of the same post type.

You can also use the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/delete-before-broadcast/">Delete Before Broadcast add-on</a> to delete any similar posts on the child blog before broadcasting.

= Timeout problems =

If you have many attachments in your post, and are broadcasting the post to many blogs, you might encounter a PHP timeout. This means that broadcasting exceeded the PHP time limit and had to be aborted.

There are several solutions to this problem:

1. Increase the PHP timeout in your PHP.ini settings. This will not speed up broadcasting, only increase your chances of completely broadcasting the post.
2. Use the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/duplicate-attachments/">Duplicate Attachments add-on</a>. This will duplicate any attachments + thumbnails instead of regenerating them on each child blog.
3. Use the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/queue/">Queue add-on</a> to put each child broadcast into a queue that is emptied by javascript.

You will not need solution #1 if you use solutions #2 and #3. :)

= Why can I not see the Broadcast meta box? =

Make sure that:

1. The plugin is network enabled
2. Your user level has broadcast access (Broadcast access role)
3. Your user has write access to more than this blog (see Admin settings > Maintenenace > View blog access). You can also use the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/all-blogs/">All Blogs add-on</a> to give yourself access to all blogs.
4. The correct post type(s) have been selected in the Broadcast settings
5. The <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/user-blog-settings/">User & Blog Settings add-on</a> is not set to hide the meta box from the user / role / blog

= WooCommerce =

Broadcast is capable of handling simple WooCommerce products.

1. In the Broadcast custom post type settings: Add "product".
2. Save the product normally first.
3. Then broadcast, selecting the custom fields and taxonomies checkboxes.

This will broadcast all normal product settings: SKU, price, etc.

If your products have variations, a product image gallery, you want to sync stock, you want to sync orders, need the attribute taxonomies to be synced, you'll be wanting the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/woocommerce/">WooCommerce add-on</a>.
