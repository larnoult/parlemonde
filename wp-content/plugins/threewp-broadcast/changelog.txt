= 38.5 20170614 =

* Fix: Broadcasted column not properly displaying linked posts for page post type.

= 38.4 20170605 =

* Tested with Wordpress v4.8
* Fix: Show "Broadcasted" column on ALL post types that are in the custom post type settings. Action has prio 100, which should ensure the columns are shown even for those badly coded plugins that reset the visible columns.

Also works with the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/find-some-unlinked-children/">Find Some Unlinked Children add-on</a>. There's also a <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/snippet/find-unlinked-children-only-on-some-blogs/">code snippet</a> showing how to use the action.

= 38 20170406 =

Finally dropped the "ThreeWP" prefix from the plugin name! The code remains the same, though, just the plugin name is changed.

* Fix: Extra check to see whether the attachment was correctly copied. Catches a fatal error when the attachment does not return with a real filename.
* Fix: Some attachments do not have proper filenames (mp3), so avoid clearing the filename completely. Fixes fatal errors when broadcasting those types of files.
* Code: Make _get_post_children function public so that the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/rebroadcast/">Rebroadcast add-on</a> can queue posts.

= 37 20170316 =

* Fix: Try to replace all media thumbnail URLs in the post content, instead of just the full image size. This will fix references to image thumbnails also.
* Fix: Plugin now uses standard Wordpress translation functions so that it can now be translated online. No experience with this, but it looks to make translation really easy.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/all-images/">All Images</a> detects all referenced local images in post text fields and adds them to the broadcast.

The next major version of Broadcast will finally have the "ThreeWP" dropped from the name. The files on disk will still be called the same, and the action names will still have the threewp prefix. Only the visible name in the repo and plugin list will change.

The add-on pack names will also lose their prefixes.

= 36 20170303 =

* Fix: Remove warning when trying to get file sizes of non-local attachments. Of course that will fail.
* Fix: Non-local attachments, when being copied, retain their GUIDs instead of getting a URL based on the child blog. This is useful for retaining CDN urls on attachments.

Please contact me if you know anything about how the Wordpress translation management works, so that we can iron out translation migration kinks before they become a problem.

= 35.9 20170216 =

* New: Also sync / broadcast term taxonomy metadata. This will automatically add support for plugins that store extra data in taxonomy metadata, like venues and organisers in the Calendarize It plugin. Developers can look at the terms_and_taxonomies trait to see how it works.
* Fix: Force setting of exactly the same post dates and modified dates on the children. This fixes the child posts sometimes being a second off. Also allows for "only if child modified" functionality in the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/protect-child-properties/">Protect Child Properties add-on</a>.
* Fix: Do not allow broadcasting to the parent blog. This is something that was possible to do via the API.
* SDK update. Removed PHPmailer class.

= 35.8 20170203 =

* Fix: Make the unchecked post actions in the meta box work again. A previous change in 35.5 broke the delete/trash option from the select box that appears when a broadcasted post is unchecked in the meta box.

= 35.7 20170127 =

* New: Add special check for incompatible plugins (only Post Type Switcher so far) and show an error message instead of broadcasting.
* Fix: Check that the child blog exists before broadcasting to it. Fixes maintenance checks failing when blogs have been deleted.
* Fix: Do extra image URL replacements in the content for all copied attachments. Requires that the images have been copied during the broadcast (attaching the image to the blog, or referring to the image in a gallery will suffice). This will take care of images that are statically referenced within shortcodes.

= 35.5 20170113 =

* Fix: If using a bulk action on a post that is not broadcasted, do not trash / delete it.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/ninja-forms/">Ninja Forms</a> adds support for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/">Ninja Forms</a> plugin.

= 35.3 20170106 =

* Code: Show Wordpress version in system info / debug.

= 35.1 20161206 =

* Fix: Extra check that attachments exist, for those times when posts are attached but don't have files.
* Fix: Ignore post type hierarchical support when checking for broadcasted parents. This fixes the fatal error when broadcasting WooCommerce Variations that, for some reason, do not support hierarchies, but still have parent posts.

= 35 20161206 =

* Fix: Do not clear the attachment_data array in the broadcasting data. Fixes WooCommerce Swatches being ignored if there are normal attachments.
* Code: More robust way of retrieving equivalent_posts. This fixes a bug when broadcasting ACF relations between two blogs with the same child posts as relations, instead of broadcasting a related post from the parent blog to a child.
* Code: Warn network admins of incompatible Broadcast and BC add-on pack versions. Users should keep the MAJOR versions of both the same.
* Code: Added support for partial broadcasts. This is used with the Queue add-on when broadcasting products with _many_ variations which normally would timeout even the most patient of servers. See broadcasting_data->partial_broadcast().

= 34.5 20161111 =

* Code: More upload_dir debugging info.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/divi-builder/">Divi Builder</a>. Adds support for <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/plugins/divi-builder/">Divi Builder</a> and themes using it. No more getting the logo on your child sites overwritten when broadcasting!

* Code: Reload child custom fields in $bcd->custom_fields()->child_fields() object upon each request.
* Code: Add plugin paths to system info.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/beaver-builder/">Beaver Builder</a>. Adds support for the <a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/">Beaver Builder page builder plugin</a>.

= 34.2 20161006 =

* Code: Handle attachments (delete, copy) before taxonomies. This prevents attachment delete+copy+delete+copy sequences when some add-ons (ACF, WooCommerce) request taxonomy attachments be copied.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/local-files/">Local Files</a>. Automatically copies local files to each blog and updates the links in the content.

= 34 20160925 =

* Fix: Prevent duplicate attachments by forcing renaming of copied attachments. This fixes the long-standing problem of attachments with numbers at the end of the filenames being duplicated.

This stems from a Wordpress feature / bug that removes the numbers when copying the images to each child blog. For some reason attachments inserted by PHP code, using normal Wordpress functions, are not assigned the same post_names as on the parent blog, which prevents Broadcast from finding the attachments when updating the post. This will cause Broadcast to recopy the attachment, creating a dupe.

* Code: Added broadcasting_data->copied_attachments_to_blog code, together with ThreeWP_Broadcast->copy_attachments_to_blog().
* The "ThreeWP" part of the plugin name will be dropped in the future.

= 33.1 20160913 =

Minor release. Upgrade not mandatory.

* Code: Initialize broadcasting_data->attachment_data array in the class.
* Code: Display even more debug info when updating / inserting the child post.
= 33 20160817 =

* Fix: Find Unlinked Children finds children with the same status. So a draft will find unlinked drafts. To find different child statuses, just change the status of the parent post before finding.
* Fix: Stricter handling of attachment paths. This fixes Amazon S3 file paths being incorrectly detected as local files by PHP.
* Code: Added collect_post_type_taxonomies action to help plugins sync extra taxonomy data, like ACF images and what not.
* Code: save_post() method returns the broadcasting_data object if anything was broadcasted.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/contact-form-7/">Contact Form 7</a>. Adds support for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/">Takayuki Miyoshi's Contact Form 7</a> plugin.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/yoast-seo/">Yoast SEO</a>. Adds support for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">Yoast SEO</a> plugin. Only needed if you want taxonomy SEO data synced when broadcasting.
* 4.6.0 compatibility.

= 32.3 20160722 =

* Fix: Check for existence of get_plugin_data() function before broadcasting. Fixes HTTP processing with Queue add-on. Quite an unexpected and illogical bug.

= 32.2 20160719 =

* Fix: A workaround for an existing Yoast SEO workaround. Fixing the first Yoast problem prevented Woocommerce variations from being broadcasted properly. Applies only to users of Yoast + Woocommerce variations.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/shortcode-attachments/">Shortcode Attachments</a> modifies attachment IDs found in shortcodes to match their equivalent attachments on each blog.

= 32 20160715 =

* Code: Added broadcasting_data->high_priority property to prevent certain plugins, like the Queue, from broadcasting posts in several steps. All API broadcasts are now set to high_priority.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/toolset/">Toolset</a> merged the old Types and Views add-ons with new support for CRED post and user forms.

= 31 20160705 =

* Fix: Yet another workaround for Yoast SEO, version 3.3.2 this time.
* New add-on: Calendarize It adds support for <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/calendarize-it-for-wordpress/2568439">Calendarize It!</a> events.
* New add-on: Events Manager adds support for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/">Events Manager</a> plugin.
* Code: post_action action will now affect child posts also. See traits/post_actions. This is for unlinking The Events Calendar recurring events.

= 30 20160606 =

* Debug: Even more debugging info in the debug dumps.
* Code: New preparse_content action which allows plugins that support the action to prepare themselves for modifying post content in different places, not only in the post content.
* Code: broadcast_data->get_linked_post_on_this_blog() checks for both a parent or a child post on this blog and returns the ID.
* Code: Added threewp_broadcast_allowed_post_statuses filter.
* New: Plugin Pack Plugin: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/tao-schedule-update/">Tao Schedule Update</a> adds support for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tao-schedule-update/">Tao Schedule Update</a> plugin.

* Fix: Allow broadcasted drafts to be rescheduled / continue to be scheduled.
* Code: During broadcasting, fetch the new post after updating it.

= 29 20160405 =

* New: Plugin Pack Plugin: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/hreflang/">Hreflang</a> adds support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hreflang">SEO-friendly hreflang html tags</a>.
* New: View Post Info maintenance check. Helps debugging by showing all information about posts and the associated postmeta.

* Fix: Prevent duplicates when referring to parent posts on the child blog. See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/acf-clone-post-issue?replies=3
