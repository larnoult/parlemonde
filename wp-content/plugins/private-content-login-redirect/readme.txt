Redirects non-logged users to login page when they follow a private post or private page link.

==Description== 

Do you post private content? Are you sending those links to your users with private content access? 

WordPress by default redirects all non-logged users to a 404(content not found) page when they follow a private post or private page link.Instead of showing a 404 page, this plugin simply redirects those users to the login page.After successful login, it automatically redirects users with private content access to the private content link they followed.

**Note**: If you post private content and want to get more subscribers to read your private content, I developed a Free plugin for that too...Check out  [Mini Membership](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mini-membership/).
