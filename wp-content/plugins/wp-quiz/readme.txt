WP Quiz Plugin is the easiest way of creating viral content that people are eager to share. Your visitors can take part in the quiz you create, and this increases engagement by leaps and bounds.

You can create an unlimited number of Quizzes with the WP Quiz plugin, and each quiz is going to be responsive. So, your visitors can take part even from their mobile handsets as well as their tablets.

We have created the plugin with latest WordPress guidelines in mind so you can rest assured that the plugin will work on all the <a href="https://mythemeshop.com/themes/" rel="nofollow">WordPress themes</a> you might have.

WP Quiz has multiple options to help create quizzes in various styles with unique layouts. Creating a Trivia, Personality, or a Flip Quiz is an extremely task. Each Quiz type comes with its very own demo data for helping you with the initial setup. Importing demo data is as easy as clicking a button.

Each quiz type has options for adding text, videos, or images. You can use any combination of these to create a unique click that your visitors will instantly like. Don’t own the images you want to use? You just simply have to add the Image Credit because the option is built in and extremely easy to use.

You can have the entire quiz on a single page or stretch is across multiple pages if there are too many questions. A traditional skin is included if you like that style with more skins coming soon.

There is a restart option for questions if a user feels like taking the quiz again. Social media buttons are built in to make it very easy for visitors to share quiz results with their friends on social media.

You can enable the Quiz to scroll automatically to the next question. This makes it extremely easy for visitors to fill out a lot of questions in a short span of time.

With the WP Quiz Plugin, you can change font colors in a jiffy. You can change the background color to match that of your theme or have it in a bright color to make the quiz stand out from rest of the content.

A progress bar is displayed for your visitors to help them know their Quiz status. You can change the color of the progress bar.

To make the questions and the quiz pop out, we have included six animation effects. These unique effects contribute to making the layout eye-catchy.

You can manually place the quiz inside any other post using the built in shortcodes. This option allows you to show the quiz inside sidebars as well.
