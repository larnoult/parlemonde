# Features
* Added WPML capabilities (see online documentation)

# Fixes
* Reduced the number of calls to *$sitepress->get_current_language()*, *$this->get_active_languages()* and *$this->get_default_language()*, to avoid running the same queries more times than needed
* Using CMS Nav in a non content page (e.g. a static page that only calls wp_head()), won't cause any warning because the $post object is null
* When HTTP_USER_AGENT is not set it won't cause any error
