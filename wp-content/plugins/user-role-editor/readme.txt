== Changelog =
= [4.45] 18.08.2018 =
* Fix: Capability checkbox was shown as turned ON incorrectly for not granted capability included into a role, JSON: "caps":{"sample_cap":"false"}. Bug took place after the changing a currently selected role.
* Fix: Custom capabilities groups "User Role Editor" and "WooCommerce" were registered at the wrong 3rd tree level - changed to 2. 

= [4.44] 05.07.2018 =
* Update: URE had executed 'profile_update' action after update of user permissions from the user permissions editor page: Users->selected user->Capabilities. 
  It was replaced with 'ure_user_permissions_update' action now. It will allow to exclude conflicts with other plugins - "WP Members" [lost checkbox fields values](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/conflict-with-wp-members-2/), for example.
* Update: Additional options for role (like "Hide admin bar" at the bottom of URE page) did not applied to the user with 'ure_edit_roles' capability. This conditon was removed.
* Update: fix PHP notice 'Undefined offset: 0 in ...' at includes/classes/protect-admin.php, not_edit_admin(), where the 1st element of $caps array not always has index 0.
* Update: PHP required version was increased up to 5.4.

= [4.43] 05.06.2018 =
* Update: references to non-existed roles are removed from the URE role additional options data storage after any role update.
* Fix: Additional options section view for the current role was not refreshed properly after other current role selection.

= [4.42] 16.05.2018 =
* Fix: Type checking was added (URE_Lib::restore_visual_composer_caps()) to fix "Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in .../user-role-editor-pro/includes/classes/ure-lib.php on line 315".

= [4.41] 07.05.2018 =
* New: URE changes currently selected role via AJAX request, without full "Users->User Role Editor" page refresh.
* Update: All [WPBakery Visual Composer](http://vc.wpbakery.com) plugin custom user capabilities (started from 'vc_access_rules_') were excluded from processing by User Role Editor. Visual Composer loses settings made via its own "Role Manager" after the role update by User Role Editor in other case. The reason - Visual Composer stores not boolean values with user capabilities granted to the roles via own "Role Manager". User Role Editor converted them to related boolean values during role(s) update.

= [4.40.3] 05.04.2018 =
* Update: bbPress detection and code for integration with it was updated to support multisite installations when URE is network activated but bbPress is activated on some sites of the network only. Free version does not support bbPress roles. It excludes them from processing as bbPress creates them dynamically.

= [4.40.2] 04.04.2018 =
* Update: Load required .php files from the active bbPress plugin directly, as in some cases URE code may be executed earlier than they are loaded by bbPress.

= [4.40.1] 09.03.2018 =
* Update: wp_roles() function (introduced with WP 4.3) was included conditionally to URE code for backward compatibility with WordPress 4.0+
* Fix: WordPress multisite: bbPress plugin detection code was changed from checking bbPress API function existence to checking WordPress active plugins list. bbPress plugin activated for the site was not available yet for the network activated User Role Editor at the point of URE instance creation. URE did not work with bbPress roles as it should by design for that reason. URE (free version) should ignore bbPress roles and capabilities as the special efforts are required for this.

= [4.40] 31.01.2018 =
* Update: use wp_roles() function from WordPress API instead of initializing $wp_roles global variable directly.
* Fix: Bug was introduced by version 4.37 with users recalculation for "All" tab after excluding users with "administrator" role. Code worked incorrectly for Japanese locale.
