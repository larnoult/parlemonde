<h2>Google Doc Viewer</h2>

<p><b>This plugin is due to be retired.</b> Changes to WordPress and Google's free doc viewer mean that this plugin should be switched for an alternative.</p>

<p>Existing gview shortcodes should still work for now.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-document-embedder/" target="_blank">plugin homepage</a> and support forums for suggestions.</p>
