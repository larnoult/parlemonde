The most comprehensive & user-friendly mapping solution for WordPress

== Description ==
We are working hard on delivering the best mapping solution available – helping you to share your favorite spots and tracks.

Display locations and directions on your WordPress site. Organize customized icons in tidy layers on a variety of maps and even in augmented reality browsers. Maps Marker Pro is your individual Geo-CMS that features highest security standards and a moral code.

With Maps Marker Pro, you can

* pin your favorites places with **markers**,
* search for locations by using keyless geocoding providers like MapZen Search, Algolia Places or Photon@MapsMarker (optional: use the geocoding providers MapQuest Geocoding or Google Places with mandatory API key registration),
* show **directions** for your locations,
* choose from over **1000 free, customizable icons** from [Maps Icons Collection](https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com),
* add **popup description text or images** for each marker,
* organize your markers in **layers**,
* choose an **individual basemap, size and zoom level** for each marker and layer map
* display your maps by just adding a **shortcode** - e.g. [mapsmarker marker="1"] - to posts, pages, widgets and templates
* on the basemap of your choice: **Open Street Map**, **Google Maps** (road, satellite, hybrid, terrain), **Bing** (aerial, aerials + labels, road), **Mapbox** (road, satellite) and any **custom WMTS-map**
* and even in **augmented-reality** browsers like Wikitude!

This plugin is built by a team with a vision. We follow a moral code and value the plugin's security, your privacy and the documentation of our work. Read our [mission statement](https://www.mapsmarker.com/our-vision-and-mission-statement/) here.
