Visit our [full system requirements](https://lifterlms.com/docs/minimum-system-requirements-lifterlms/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) for additional information.

#### Automatic Installation

This is the simplest way to install LifterLMS as it utilizes WordPress to handle file transfers and you never need to leave the web browser or admin panel.

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Navigate to Plugins -> Add New
3. In the search field type "LifterLMS" and click "Search Plugins"
4. Once you've located LifterLMS click "Install Now"
5. Once installation is complete, click "Activate"

#### Manual Installation

To manually install LifterLMS you'll need to download the zip file using the "Download" link on this screen. You'll then need to use FTP to manually upload the files to the proper directory on your webserver.

Please see this [WordPress Codex document](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) for full instruction on Manual Plugin Installation.

You can return to the setup wizard at any time by following [these steps](https://lifterlms.com/docs/rerun-lifterlms-setup-wizard/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

Users of the free LifterLMS should post their questions in the plugin's WordPress.org forum.

We can provide a deeper level of support here and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.

= v3.23.0 - 2018-08-27 =
------------------------

##### Access Plan & Pricing Table Template Improvements

+ The pricing table template has been split into multiple templates which are now rendered via action hooks. No visual changes have been made but if you've customized the template using a template override you'll want to review the template changes before updating!
+ New action hooks are available to modify the rendering of access plans in course / membership pricing tables.

  + `llms_access_plan`: Main hook for outputting an entire access plan within the pricing table
  + `llms_before_access_plan`: Called before main content of access plan. Outputs the "Featured" area of plans
  + `llms_acces_plan_content`: Main access plan content. Outputs title, pricing info, restrictions, and description
  + `llms_acces_plan_footer`: Called after main content. Outputs trial info and the checkout / enrollment button

+ Added filters to the returns of many of the functions in the `LLMS_Acces_Plan` model.
+ Minor improvements made to `LLMS_Access_Plan` model

##### Updates and Enhancements

+ Improved handling of empty blank / empty data when adding instructors to courses and memberships
+ Added filters to the "Sales Page Content" type options & functions for courses and memberships to allow 3rd parties to define their own type of sales page functionality
+ Added filters to the saving of access plan data
+ Improved the HTML and added CSS classes to the access plan admin panel html view

##### Bug Fixes

+ Fixes issue causing the "Preview Changes" button on courses to lock the "Update" publishing button which prevents changes from being properly saved.gi
+ Fixed issue causing PHP errors when viewing courses / memberships on the admin panel when an instructor user was deleted
+ Fixed issue causing PHP notices when viewing course / membership post lists on the admin panel when an instructor user was deleted
+ Fixed issue causing PHP warnings to be generated when viewing the user add / edit screen on the admin panel

------------------------

+ Frontend notifications are no longer powered by AJAX requests.

+ Tested to WordPress 4.9.8

##### Template Updates

+ [templates/checkout/form-summary.php](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/blob/master/templates/checkout/form-summary.php)

+ Fixed plugin compatibility issue with Advanced Custom Fields
+ Fixed issue causing multiple choice quiz questions to require a double tap on some iOS devices
+ Fixed incorrectly named filter causing section titles to not display on student course reporting screens
+ We do not advocate using PHP 5.5 or lower but if you were using 5.5 or lower and encountered an error during bulk enrollment we've fixed that for. Please upgrade to 7.2 though. We all want faster more secure websites.

##### Template Updates

+ [templates/checkout/form-checkout.php](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/blob/master/templates/checkout/form-checkout.php)
+ [templates/global/form-login.php](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/blob/master/templates/global/form-login.php)

  + Do nothing (show course description)
  + Show custom content (use a WYSIWYG editor to define content)
  + Redirect to a WordPress page (use custom templates and enhance page builder compatibility and capabilities)
  + Redirect to a custom URL (use a sales page hosted on another domain!)
+ Tested to WordPress 4.9.7

= v3.19.6 - 2018-07-06 =
------------------------

= v3.19.5 - 2018-07-05 =

+ Fixed issue causing admin panel static assets to have a double slash (//) in the assest URI path
+ FIxed issue allowing users with `view_lifterlms_reports` capability (Instructors) to access sales & enrollment reporting screens. The `view_others_lifterlms_reports` capability (Admins & LMS Managers) is now required to view these reporting tabs.
+ Updated IDs of login and registration nonces to be unique. Fixes an issue causing Chrome to throw non-unique ID warnings in the developer console. Also, IDs are supposed to be unique _anyway_ but thanks for helping us out Google.
