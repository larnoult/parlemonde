== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why add these actions? =
Because unattach is useful when you do a mistake when linking a media to a post. Default action only offers to erase the media (file) :-(.

= What about the source? =
The goal to create this plugin came when reading the source of davidn.de (which was not OOP made and not maintained since one year): here no too hacky approach, only good hooks, security (nonce, check_admin_referer) and class active only in admin side.
Inline 'translation ready' help or pointer (35% of the lines).

= What about WP 4.x =
To recover the list, you must be in table mode (see icon on top right).

== Screenshots ==
1. The new actions in Media Library list in column File.
2. The new action in Media Library list in column File with only unattached files selection.
3. Icon list or thumbnail mode in WP 4.0-alpha.
4. The metabox with infos and actions about attached post.
